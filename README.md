## Why Jigsaw?

Jigsaw is a complete and powerful Web components set. The current version contains 39 components, 6 containers, 5 services, and 5 directives, basically covering all aspects of Web applications. Simply put, Jigsaw has almost all the functions of other component sets, and Jigsaw is more powerful and has better performance. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the lack of functionality with Jigsaw.

Jigsaw has an ability that other component sets do not have: **Jigsaw’s application can support multiple Ux specifications at the same time in one development**. [Click here](https://jigsaw-zte.gitee.io/latest/#/components/guide/supports-multiple-ux-specifications) to learn more about it.

## Meaning Of Name
We name this suite of components from a puzzle game. The process of this game, during which the player combine the messy pieces into a picture in accordance with the established blueprint, is similar to the development process of modern web page. We use Jigsaw as this component set’s name, hoping to make web page developers to combine the messy pieces of functions into your web page, just like playing jigsaw puzzle.

The soul of Jigsaw is **combination**, and we are committed to develop combination to the extreme level.

When several components are sorted and arranged in a certain order, you can get an application page. This is a normal combination, which we definee as **Level I** combination. In this level, all the components are like atoms, which means they can only act what they were made.

But Jigsaw's components are no longer atoms, we made a secondary abstraction of the functionality of the components, while allowing parts of the components highly customizable, some component even fully customizable. Small to  basic components like `jigsaw-button`, large to  giant components such as `jigsaw-table`, almost every UI element you see can be combined with other components to change its default behavior, and therefor to enhance the capability of components. Atomic components are limited, but the combination can produce infinite possibilities. The customization mentioned here, in other words, is another form of combination, and we call this level of combination as Level II.

With Jigsaw, unleash your imagination!


## Get Started
### A brand new start with Jigsaw
We strongly recommend to use [Jigsaw Seed](https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw-seed) as the seed of all new projects. The specific steps are:
1. Install or update [nodejs](https://nodejs.org), node 6.x.x and npm 3.x.x or later is required;
2. [Download](https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw-seed/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw-seed) the source of Jigsaw Seed, assumed being saved to `d:\jigsaw-seed`;
3. Install all dependencies by excuting the following script:

```
cd d:\jigsaw-seed
npm config set registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org/                 # for Chinese developers only
npm config set sass_binary_site https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass # for Chinese developers only
npm install -g @angular/cli                                              # optional, but strongly recommended
npm install
npm start
```

- **Attensions to the Chinese developers**, do **NOT** use `cnpm` to install the dependencies because of [this issue](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmjs.org/issues/1463).
- **Attensions to all ZTErs**, you can use the npm mirror inside of ZTE for faster speed of installing, [check this link for more details](docs/how-to-use-npm-mirror-inside-of-zte/index.md).

4. Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser, your development environment is completed set up if you can see the welcome page;
5. Afterwards you can directly run `npm start` in the `d:\jigsaw-seed` directory to start the development environment;
6. Jigsaw has specifically done code optimization for the modern IDE, so that IDE can accurately prompt more information, saving your time of reading api document. We recommend using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as IDE.

### Use Jigsaw with your developing project
See the specific process [here](docs/integrate-your-project-with-jigsaw/index.md)

## A bible for the beginners
[Jigsaw Tourist](https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw-tourist) is a tutorial dedication to the beginners, which shows how to use Jigsaw from scratch to build a simple application page. Click [here](docs/tourist/index.md), bravely take your first step in Jigsaw.
